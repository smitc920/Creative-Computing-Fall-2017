var Poem = "on a river bank and holding a flower, plucking the petals one by one, there I am standing amiss behind a tree, staring at me as if I don’t see you there you are. I ask you a simple question why is life so complicated? and you walked out slyly because you didn’t know I knew you were there and you answered if it weren’t, there would be no love but I don’t have that anyway I reply and in your head I know you’re thinking oh but you do, you have it from me but I sat there so obliviously I didn’t ever tell you but I loved you too that was the only secret that I ever kept from you and when we chased each other in the creek You didn’t ever tell that you were falling in love with me and we were just children they would always say but children are the wisest in a special kind of way they see people for who they are and they don’t know corruption as personally as they will grow up to but for now they look into each other’s souls and choose their friends for life you see it all started as children when we all had our sight but now we are blind to the untruthful ones we could sense it like we could sense that winter was here and that a big snow was coming but now we are so desperate for love because it’s not so easy anymore and we forget the simplicity of the emotion If you love someone, let the love grow let it blossom like it knows no limits and indulge in life on that feeling that you were a child again in love."
